## Taffrail Showcase

Taffrail has built an API that brokerages and banks integrate into their existing apps to provide their clients with compliant recommendations and guidance.

This is our Advice showcase app. Integrating our Advice API into your app is demonstrated in this fully-functional javascript app. We created this project and open sourced the code to make it easier for you to explore using our Advice API.
