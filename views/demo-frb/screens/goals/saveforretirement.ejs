<!-- <h2>Save for Retirement</h2> -->
<p>The typical advice is that you should aim to replace 70% to 90% of your annual pre-retirement income through savings and
Social Security. For example, a retiree who earns an average of $63,000 per year before retirement should expect to need
$44,000 to $57,000 per year in retirement.</p>
